## Code Challenge 32

### Challenge: Find common values in 2 binary trees.

Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: tree-intersection

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

* Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters. Using a Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.
* Arguments: two binary trees
* Return: A set of common values


### Structure and Testing

Four tests written to prove functionality:

1. Empty case where both trees are empty, should return empty set
2. Empty case where one tree is empty, should return an empty set
3. Simple case where both trees have one common value, should return a set with the one common value
4. Complex case where both trees have multiple common values, should return a set with the multiple common values.
