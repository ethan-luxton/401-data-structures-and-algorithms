## Code Challenge 33

### Implementation: Hashmap Left Join

Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: hashmap-left-join

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

* Write a function called left join
    * Arguments: two hash maps
    * The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    * The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

* Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic


### Structure and Testing

Three tests written to prove functionality:

1. Simple test case, Synonym hashmap has two key/value pairs, Antonyms have one.
2. Interesting test case, Synonym hashmap has five key/value pairs, Antonyms have four.
3. Empty case, Synonym hashmap has no key/value pairs, Antonyms have none.
