Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: hashmap-repeated-table

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

* Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
* Arguments: string
* Return: string


### Structure and Testing

Six tests written to prove functionality:

1. Simple test case, smaller string.
2. Interesting test case, medium sized string.
3. Long test case, large string.
