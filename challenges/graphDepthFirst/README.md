Branch Name: graph-depth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation

## Feature Tasks

Write a function that conducts a depth first traversal of a graph.
* Arguments: Starting Node
* Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
* Program output: Display the collection

### Structure and Testing
