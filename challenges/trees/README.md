## Code Challenge 14

### Implementation: Binary Tree and BST Implementation

Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: trees

Challenge Type: New Implementation

## Feature Tasks

### Node

* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

### Binary Tree

* Create Binary Tree class
    * Define a method for each of thre depth frist traversals
        * pre order
        * in order
        * post orderwsd

    * Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree

* Create a Binary Search Tree class
    * This class should be a sub-class(or dlanguages equivalent) of Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
    * Add
        * Arguments: value
        * return: nothing
        * Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in binary search tree.

### Structure and Testing

Writing tests to prove the following functionality:

1. Can sucessfully instantiate an empty tree
2. Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
3. For a Binary Search Tree, can successfully add a left child and right child properly to a node
4. Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
5. Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
6. Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
7. Returns true || false for the contains method, given an existing or non-existing node value
