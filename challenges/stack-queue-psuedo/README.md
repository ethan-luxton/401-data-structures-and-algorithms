## Code Challenge 10

### Implementation: Stacks and Queues

Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: stack-queue-pseudo

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

* Create a new class called pseudo queue.
    * Do not use an existing Queue.
    * Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
    * Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue
* Methods:
    * enqueue
        * Arguments: value
        * Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    * dequeue
        * Arguments: none
        * Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
